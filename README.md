## About The Project

The main goal is to recommend animes to users. Therefore, currently three approaches are followed: 
* [recommendation by the rate of common tags](https://github.com/cuteopamp/anime-recommender/blob/main/recommender/anime_recommender_by_tags.ipynb)
    * user enters tags that s/he is interested in
    * then it recommends animes by common tags 
* [recommendation by clustering using KMeans and PCA](https://github.com/cuteopamp/anime-recommender/blob/main/recommender/pca_anime_clustering.ipynb)
    * there are clusters formed by user data
    * user can select which cluster is relevant her/his taste
* [recommendation by clustering using KMeans and t-SNE](https://github.com/cuteopamp/anime-recommender/blob/main/recommender/tsne_anime_recommender.ipynb)
    * there are clusters formed by user data
    * user can select which cluster is relevant her/his taste
