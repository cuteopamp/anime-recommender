## About The Project

The main goal is to recommend animes to users. Therefore, currently two approaches are followed: 
* recommendation by the rate of common tags
    * user enters tags that s/he is interested in
    * then it recommends animes by common tags 
* recommendation by clustering using KMeans and PCA
    * there are clusters formed by user data
    * user can select which cluster is relevant her/his taste
